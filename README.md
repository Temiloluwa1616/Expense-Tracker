State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management, handling:
- Transaction data
- Form state
- Income/expense totals
- UI state (modals, form values)

Component Documentation

 Main Component (`main/index.js`)

Purpose: Primary dashboard container with gradient background and main layout

Key Features:
- Responsive header with app title and add transaction button
- Beautiful gradient background with animated overlays
- Container for Summary and ExpenseView components
- Modern glassmorphism design elements

Propss: None (uses global context)

Summary Component (`summary/index.js`)

Purpose: Displays financial overview with balance, income, expense stats, and chart

Key Features:
- Current balance display with positive/negative indicators
- Side-by-side income and expense cards with hover animations
- Integrated donut chart for visual representation
- Responsive layout that stacks on mobile devices

Props:
- `onClose`: Function to close transaction modal
- `isOpen`: Boolean for modal open state
- `totalExpense`: Number representing total expenses
- `totalIncome`: Number representing total income

TransactionForm Component (`add-transactions/index.js`)

Purpose: Modal form for adding new income or expense transactions

Key Features:
- Modern modal with blur backdrop and glassmorphism effects
- Form validation for required fields
- Custom radio button styling for transaction type selection
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Gradient header with accent line


Props:
- `onClose`: Function to close the modal
- `isOpen`: Boolean to control modal visibility

Form Fields:
- `description`: Text input for transaction description
- `amount`: Number input for transaction amount
- `type`: Radio selection (income/expense)


 ExpenseView Component (`expense-view/index.js`)

Purpose: Displays filtered lists of transactions by type (income or expense)

Key Features:
- Dynamic styling based on transaction type
- Empty state with helpful messaging
- Individual transaction cards with hover animations
- Responsive design with smooth transitions
- Item count badge



Props:
- `type`: String ("income" or "expense")
- `data`: Array of filtered transactions

 TransactionChartSummary Component (`chart/index.js`)

Purpose: Interactive donut chart visualization using ApexCharts

Key Features:
- Animated donut chart with gradient fills
- Custom tooltips with detailed information
- Responsive design with breakpoint handling
- Hover and active state animations
- Modern styling with shadows and effects

Props:
- `expense`: Number (default: 100)

Global Context

 GlobalState Provider

Location: `context/index.js`

State Properties:

{
  formData: {
    type: "income" | "expense",
    amount: number,
    description: string
  },
  value: "income" | "expense",
  totalExpense: number,
  totalIncome: number,
  allTransactions: Transaction[]
}


Available Methods:
- `setFormData`: Update form data
- `setValue`: Set transaction type for radio buttons
- `setTotalExpense`: Update total expense amount
- `setTotalIncome`: Update total income amount
- `setAllTransactions`: Update transactions array
- `handleFormSubmit`: Process new transaction submission



 Transaction Object Structure
{
  id: number,           // Timestamp-based unique identifier
  type: string,         // "income" or "expense"
  amount: number,       // Transaction amount
  description: string   // User-provided description
}




Design System

Interactive States:
- Hover effects with `translateY` transforms
- Focus states with colored borders and shadows
- Active states with reduced transforms

Animation Patterns

Micro-interactions:
- Button hover: `translateY(-2px)` with enhanced shadows
- Card hover: `translateY(-4px)` with color transitions
- Form focus: Border color changes with smooth transitions

Loading States:
- Chart animations with `easeinout` easing
- Gradient animations for accent elements
- Staggered entry animations for transaction lists



Getting Started

 Prerequisites

 Required dependencies
npm install react react-dom
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
npm install react-apexcharts apexcharts


Installation

1. Clone and setup:
git clone the repo
cd expense-tracker
npm install


2. **Start development server**:

npm start


3. Open browser: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`



 Usage Examples

Adding a Transaction:
1. Click the "Add Transaction" button in the header
2. Fill in description and amount
3. Select income or expense type
4. Click "Add Transaction" to save

Viewing Balance:
- Current balance is automatically calculated and displayed
- Green indicates positive balance, red indicates deficit
- Visual chart shows proportion of income vs expenses




 Adding New Features

Transaction Categories:
1. Extend the form data structure to include category
2. Add category selection to TransactionForm
3. Update ExpenseView to group by categories
4. Modify chart to show category breakdown



Data Persistence:
1. Add localStorage integration to GlobalContext
2. Implement data save/load methods
3. Add export functionality for transaction data

 Performance Optimization

Large Transaction Lists:
- Implement virtualization for long transaction lists
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling
- Use React.memo for transaction list items

Chart Performance:
- Implement lazy loading for chart component
- Add loading states for data calculations
- Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback



 Testing Considerations

 Component Testing
- Test form validation and submission
- Verify balance calculations
- Check responsive design breakpoints
- Validate accessibility features

 Integration Testing
- Test complete transaction flow
- Verify context state updates
- Check chart data synchronization
